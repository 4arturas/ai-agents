# Problem-Solving Frameworks

This file contains a collection of problem-solving frameworks that can be used to structure your thinking and approach complex tasks.

## 1. Cognitive Loop

A framework for iterative problem-solving and learning.

*   **OBSERVE:** Analyze the current situation and gather information.
*   **THINK:** Formulate a plan or hypothesis based on your observations.
*   **DECIDE:** Choose the best course of action.
*   **LEARN:** Reflect on the outcome and identify lessons for the future.

## 2. Divide and Conquer

A recursive strategy for breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

*   **DIVIDE:** Break the problem into smaller, independent sub-problems.
*   **CONQUER:** Solve the sub-problems recursively. If a sub-problem is small enough, solve it directly.
*   **COMBINE:** Combine the solutions to the sub-problems to form the solution to the original problem.

## 3. Agile Methodology

An iterative approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility and customer collaboration.

*   **SPRINT PLANNING:** Plan a short cycle of work (sprint) to deliver a small, incremental improvement.
*   **DAILY SCRUM:** Hold a brief daily meeting to synchronize the team and track progress.
*   **SPRINT REVIEW:** Demonstrate the work completed during the sprint to stakeholders.
*   **SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE:** Reflect on the sprint and identify opportunities for improvement.

## 4. The 5 Whys

A simple but powerful technique for root cause analysis.

*   **IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM:** State the problem clearly.
*   **ASK "WHY?":** Ask why the problem occurred.
*   **REPEAT:** Continue asking "why" for each answer until you arrive at the root cause.

## 5. SWOT Analysis

A strategic planning technique used to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

*   **STRENGTHS:** Internal attributes that give an advantage.
*   **WEAKNESSES:** Internal attributes that create a disadvantage.
*   **OPPORTUNITIES:** External factors that could be exploited to an advantage.
*   **THREATS:** External factors that could cause trouble.

## 6. Design Thinking

A human-centered approach to innovation that integrates the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

*   **EMPATHIZE:** Understand the user's needs and pain points.
*   **DEFINE:** Clearly articulate the problem you are trying to solve.
*   **IDEATE:** Brainstorm a wide range of potential solutions.
*   **PROTOTYPE:** Create a low-fidelity version of the solution to test.
*   **TEST:** Gather feedback on the prototype and iterate.

## 7. The Scientific Method

A systematic approach to acquiring knowledge and testing hypotheses.

*   **OBSERVATION:** Make an observation about the world.
*   **QUESTION:** Formulate a question based on the observation.
*   **HYPOTHESIS:** Propose a testable explanation for the observation.
*   **EXPERIMENT:** Design and conduct an experiment to test the hypothesis.
*   **ANALYSIS:** Analyze the results of the experiment.
*   **CONCLUSION:** Draw a conclusion based on the analysis and refine the hypothesis.
